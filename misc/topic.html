	<h2><b>Importance:</b></h2>
<p align="justify">Taking action to combat the spread of fake news is of utmost importance due to its significant impact on our society. When individuals are influenced by false or misleading information, it can affect their decision-making process and have far-reaching consequences for society as a whole. Furthermore, the circulation of fake news erodes the trust people place in credible news sources, making it increasingly challenging to distinguish between reliable and unreliable information. The issue of fake news assumes critical importance because it can be intentionally employed to manipulate public opinion on vital matters such as elections, public policy, and social issues. This poses a threat to the democratic process as individuals are swayed by falsehoods and unable to form informed judgments based on factual and dependable information. In essence, combating the spread of fake news is pivotal as it serves as a fundamental pillar for our society, allowing us to make well-informed decisions based on accurate and reliable information.
